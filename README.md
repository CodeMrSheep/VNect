# VNect

A tensorflow implementation of [VNect: Real-time 3D Human Pose Estimation with a Single RGB Camera](http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/VNect/).

For the **caffe model** required in the repository: please contact [the author of the paper](http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/VNect/).

## Environments

- Windows 10 Pro
- Python 3.5.6 (64 bit)
  - opencv-python 3.4.4.19
  - tensorflow-gpu 1.12.0
  - [pycaffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/windows)
  - matplotlib 3.0.0 （recommanded）
  - ……



## Usage

### Preparation

1. Drop the caffe model into `models/caffe_model`.
2. Run `load_weights.py` to generate tensorflow model.

### Application

1. `benchmark.py` is a class implementation containing all the elements needed to run the model.

2. `run_estimator.py` is a script processing the **video stream**.

3. To run the model in `benchmark.py` and `run_estimator.py`:

   i ) click the left mouse button to confirm a simple static bounding box generated by HOG method;

   ii) trigger any keyboard input to exit at any time.

4. `run_pic.py` is a script processing **one single picture**: the outputs are 4×21 heatmaps and 2D results.



## Notes

1. The input image in this implementation is in **BGR** color format (cv2.imread()) and the pixel value is regulated into a range of [-0.4, 0.6).
2. The joint-parent map (detailed information in `joint_index.xlsx`):

3. The joint positions (index numbers as above):

</p>


4. Every input image is assumed to contain 21 joints to be found, which means it is easy to fit wrong results when a joint is actually not in the input.
5. In some cases the estimation results are **not so good** as the results shown in the paper author's promotional video.



## TODO

1. Optimize the structure of the codes.
2. Implement a better bounding box strategy.
3. Figure out the reason why **matplotlib 3.0.2** is likely to be stuck (matplotlib 3.0.0 is recommended in this repo).
4. Implement the training script.
